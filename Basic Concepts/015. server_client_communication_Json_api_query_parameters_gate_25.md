# JSON

- JSON stands for **Java Script Object Notation**
- It is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, like XML, HTML...
- It looks very similar to the typical JS objects that we know of like give below
```Js
let myObj = {
    "name": "Samar Singla",
    "age" : 21,
    "data": {
        "abc": 123,
        "efg": 456,
        "hij": 789,

        "more complex": [
            {
                "url": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com"
                "name": "random1
            },
            {
                "url": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com"
                "name": "random2"
            },
            {
                "url": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com"
                "name": "random3"
            }
        ]
        }
}
```
Not much difference but as we can see the JSON in an API is much more complicated and looks something like this

# API

- API stands for Application Programmable Interface

- API acts as a doorway/medium between the client and the server. 
- We can access some resources on a database or server by submiting the resource to it's API
- For Example: With Postman API we can create and send requests like
  - SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
  - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetery Transport)
  - REST (Representation State Transfer)
  - HTTP
    - GET: used to request data from a specified resource. <br>
        Ex: Inquiring movie list 
    - POST: used to send data to a server to create/update/delete a resource. <br>
        Ex: User sign up, withdrawal of membership, changing passwords etc...
  - GraphQL 
  - gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

### Passing Data using GET method: - 
For Example: google.com/search?q=iPhone&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
- In this url, we can see that, the query parameter (or the data to be sent to the server) starts after **`?`**
- Data fields can be separated using the **`&`** character

* Here, q=iPhone (search query)
* sourceid=chrome (Broswer Information)
* ie = UTF-8 (encoding information)
  
** The frontent and backend developers discuss and decide upon the names like video code ~~ v and etc... because backend dev works on this data received by the frontend designed according to the accepted names and norms  **

### URL Structure

* A url like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg` can be divided into two parts

1. Server Address https://www.youtube.com/watch (this is constant)
2. The **Query Parameter*: v=gdZLi9oWNZg (this is variable for each video)
