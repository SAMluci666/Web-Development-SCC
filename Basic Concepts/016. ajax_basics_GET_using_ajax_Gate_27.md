# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)

- used to develop web applications - Dynamic 
- combination of client-side technologies (group)
<!-- XMLHttpRequest built-in browser object – To demand data from the webserver
HTML DOM and JavaScript – To showcase or use information -->
  
  ![Group of Technologies - AJAX](https://static.javatpoint.com/fullformpages/images/ajax-full-form.png)
- It uses JS to make things like **expanders, plus boxes, small animations** 
- Makes web pages look more responsive because it exchanges small packets of data with the server insteaad of reloading the page completely ecah time user makes a change.
- Therefore, it is about loading data in the background and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page 
- In an **AJAX requrest**, the *sequence of actions happens behind the scenes, **asynchronously***. 

- **History**: Used by Jesse James Garrett from 2005

## Application of AJAX
- AJAX can be used CSS & HTML for the presentation.
- The DOM (Document Object Model) to showcase and interact dynamically with information.
- JSON as well as XML for Data Interchange
- XMLHttpRequest to communicate asynchronously
## Limitations of AJAX
- It will only be incorporated in the supporting browsers
- Ajax doesn’t facilitate specific screen-reading techniques.
- Some Ajax-supporting screen reading techniques will still be unable to read optimally generated content correctly.
- Bookmarking and returning to a specific state of implementation is difficult.
- It results in a complicated code that is difficult to maintain, to debug and also to code.

## Using AJAX
- To use AJAX we need Jquery? 
  - Without jQuery, AJAX coding can be a bit tricky. (but it's possible as we will have to write extra code to test for different browsers)
  - jQuery provides several methods for AJAX functionality
  - with these methods we can request text, HTML, XML, or JSON from a remote server using both HTTP Get and HTTP Post - And you can load the external data directly into the selected HTML elements of your web page!

- Thus if we try to use AJAX in a website that doesn't have jQuery imported we get 
```
Uncaught TypeError: $.ajax is not a function
```

## The Basic Structure of AJAX

```Js
$.ajax({
    type: "GET",
     // for GET method data is appended in the URL itself
    url: "https://url_here.com/watch?v=asdjfa&quality=mp4",
    data: {},     //blank for HTTP GET requests 
    //Useful for POST Requests

   
    success: function(response){
        console.log(response)
    }
});
```
- GET requests can include data with the request by appending that data to the end of the main URL

```
http://google.com?param=value&param2=value2 
```

- POST requests can send data with the request by including it in the data: {} field
```js 
data: { param: 'value', param2: 'value2' },
```

- **success:** If your AJAX requests "succeeds", the function specified in the success field is given the response from the server, and then that function is executed.

### Example: 1

```Js
$.ajax({
    "type": "GET",
    url: "http://spartacodingclub.shop/en/global_air/mumbai",
    data: {},
    success: function(response){
        console.log(response)
    }
}
);

```

* to further apply filters
```js
$.ajax({
    "type": "GET",
    url: "http://spartacodingclub.shop/en/global_air/mumbai",
    data: {},
    success: function(response){
        //to get only the forecast data
        let dates = response['data']['forecast']
        //to get only the forecast data of a certain day
        let dates = response['data']['forecast'][1];
        console.log(dates);
    }
}
)
```

Output:
```
{avg: 89, day: '2024-08-25', max: 89, min: 89}
```
#### Now let's store the data in separate variables: -

```Js
$.ajax({
    "type": "GET",
    url: "http://spartacodingclub.shop/en/global_air/mumbai",
    data: {},
    success: function(response){
        let dates = response['date']['forecast'][2];
        let avg = dates['avg'];
        let day = dates['day'];
        let max = dates['max'];
        let min = dates['min'];
        console.log(day,max,min, avg);
    }
});
```
### Example: 2:
```js
$.ajax({
  type: "GET",
  url: "http://spartacodingclub.shop/en/global_air/seoul",
  data: {},
  success: function(response){ 
    let dates = response['data']['forecast'];
    for (let i = 0; i < dates.length; i++) {
        let day = dates[i]['day']
        let avg = dates[i]['avg']
        console.log(day,avg)
    }
  }
})
```
